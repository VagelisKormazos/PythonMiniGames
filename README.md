## What Students Learn from This Game

This game teaches students several important concepts in programming and computer science:

1. **Event-driven programming:** 
   - The game responds to user inputs (clicks) through event handlers like `onclick()`, teaching students how to structure programs to react to events.

2. **Global vs. Local Variables:** 
   - Students learn about global and local variables, how to modify them, and when to use `global` to make changes inside functions.

3. **Loops and Conditional Statements:** 
   - The countdown logic involves a loop that decreases the time and conditional statements to control the flow of the game (start/stop game, check if time is over).

4. **Timers and Non-blocking Code:** 
   - Instead of using `time.sleep()`, which freezes the program, the game uses `ontimer()`. This teaches students about non-blocking programming, which is crucial for creating interactive programs.

5. **Graphics with Turtle Module:** 
   - The game uses the Turtle module to draw and move objects on the screen, introducing students to basic computer graphics and how to interact with objects programmatically.

6. **User Interface (UI) Design:** 
   - Writing text on the screen and updating the score and time helps students learn how to create a simple user interface, important for designing games and applications.

7. **Code Structure and Function Usage:** 
   - By dividing the game logic into different functions (e.g., `clickCounter()`, `timeCountdown()`, `startGameHandler()`), students learn about breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts and writing reusable code.
